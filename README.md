# Coldfusion-11-Application.cfc-Template
A script style Application.cfc template with all methods for Coldfusion 11.

I was frustrated with Adobe's documentation and the lack of script style Coldfusion 11 examples so I created this.

# How to use
1. Change the Application name.
2. Modify the Application variables and settings as needed.
3. Remove any callback functions that you don't need, if you wish.
4. Add your own processing code as needed.
5. Keep this file in the root of your Coldfusion project folder and it will set up your application.

# License
No license, copy and use this as you need. I picked and pulled bits from a bunch of places.
